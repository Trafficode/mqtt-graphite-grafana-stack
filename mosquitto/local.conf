# Mosquitto Local Configuration
# Location: /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/local.conf

# This configuration makes Mosquitto 2.0.21 behave like version 1.5.7
# for backward compatibility with existing devices and clients.

# Listen on all network interfaces on port 1883
# CRITICAL for Mosquitto 2.0+: Must specify bind_address or it defaults to localhost-only!
listener 1883 0.0.0.0

# Allow anonymous connections (1.5.7 default behavior)
# In Mosquitto 2.x, this must be explicitly enabled
